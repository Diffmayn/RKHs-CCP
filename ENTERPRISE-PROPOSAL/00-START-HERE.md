## 🎓 Final Tips

1. **Lead with business value, not technology**  
   Say "€750K savings" before "Electron framework"

2. **Show, don't tell**  
   A 30-second demo beats 100 slides

3. **Know your numbers cold**  
   95%, €750K, 6 months, €123K, 4 hours→12 minutes

4. **Handle objections calmly**  
   All answers are in these documents

5. **Ask for next step**  
   Don't leave without scheduling follow-up

6. **Be confident**  
   You have a solid business case backed by data
