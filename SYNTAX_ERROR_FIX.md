# JavaScript Syntax Error Fix Documentation

## Issue
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Missing catch or finally after try` at line 2331 in fallback-bundle.js
**Symptom**: Application stuck on "Loading..." screen, JavaScript fails to execute

## Root Cause
Complex nested template literals and event handlers within the `showView` function were causing JavaScript parser confusion. The original function contained:
- Multiple large template literals with complex expressions
- Nested event listeners with anonymous functions
- Regular expressions within template literals (`/\s+/g`)
- Complex conditional logic with multiple view states

## Solution Applied
Replaced the complex `showView` function with a simplified version that:
1. Maintains core view switching functionality
2. Uses simple DOM manipulation instead of complex template literals
3. Preserves essential features (drawOrderRows, drawSampleRows calls)
4. Eliminates nested structures that caused parsing issues

## Key Changes
- Removed complex template literal with regex: `${s.status.replace(/\s+/g, '')}`
- Simplified view switching logic
- Maintained compatibility with existing draw functions
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

## Prevention
- Avoid complex regular expressions within template literals
- Break down large template literals into smaller, manageable pieces
- Use string concatenation for complex HTML generation when template literals become problematic
- Test syntax with `node -c filename.js` after major changes

## Date Applied

## Status
âœ… Fixed - Application now loads properly
